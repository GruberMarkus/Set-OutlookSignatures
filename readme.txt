General description

Downloads centrally stored signatures, replaces variables, optionally
sets default signatures.
Signatures can be applied to all (mailbox) users, specific groups or
specific mail addresses.
Signature templates can be assigned time ranges within which they are
valid.
Signatures are also set in Outlook Web for the currently logged-on user.

Requirements

Requires Outlook and Word, at least version 2010.
The script must run in the security context of the currently logged-on
user.
The script must run in PowerShell Full Language mode. Constrained
Language mode is not supported, as some features such as BASE64
conversions are not available in this mode or require very slow
workarounds. If you use AppLocker or a comparable solution, you may need
to digitally sign the PowerShell script.
The path to the signature template files (SignatureTemplatePath) must be
accessible by the currently logged-on user. The template files must be
at least readable for the currently logged-on user.

Parameters

SignatureTemplatePath

The parameter SignatureTemplatePath tells the script where signature
template files are stored.
Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute
('C:\Signature templates') or relative to the script path ('.\Signature
templates').
WebDAV paths are supported (https only):
'https://server.domain/SignatureSite/SignatureTemplates' or
'\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\SignatureTemplates'
The currently logged-on user needs at least read access to the path.
Default value: '.\Signature templates'

ReplacementVariableConfigFile

The parameter ReplacementVariableConfigFile tells the script where the
file defining replacement variables is located.
Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute
('C:\config\default replacement variables.txt') or relative to the
script path ('.\config\default replacement variables.txt').
WebDAV paths are supported (https only):
'https://server.domain/SignatureSite/config/default replacement
variables.txt' or '\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\config\default
replacement variables.txt'
The currently logged-on user needs at least read access to the file.
Default value: '.\config\default replacement variables.txt'

DomainsToCheckForGroups

The parameters tells the script which domains should be used to search
for mailbox and user group membership.
The default value, '*' tells the script to query all trusted domains in
the Active Directory forest of the logged-on user.
For a custom list of domains/forests, specify them as comma-separated
list of strings: "domain-a.local", "dc=example,dc=com",
"domain-b.internal".
When a domain/forest in the custom list starts with a dash or minus
('-domain-a.local'), this domain is removed from the list.
The '*' entry in a custom list is only considered when it is the first
entry of the list.
The Active Directory forest of the currently logged-on user is always
considered.
Default value: '*'

DeleteUserCreatedSignatures

Shall the script delete signatures which were created by the user
itself? The default value for this parameter is $false.
Remark: The script always deletes signatures which were deployed by the
script earlier, but are no longer available in the central repository.
Default value: $false

SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature

Shall the script set the Outlook Web signature of the currently logged
on user?
Default value: $true

Outlook signature path

The Outlook signature path is retrieved from the users registry, so the
script is language independent.
The registry setting does not allow for absolute paths, only for paths
relative to '%APPDATA%\Microsoft'.
If the relative path set in the registry would be a valid path but does
not exist, the script creates it.

AdditionalSignaturePath

An additional path that the signatures shall be copied to.
Ideally, this path is available on all devices of the user, for example via OneDrive.
This way, the user can easily copy-paste his preferred preconfigured signature for use in a mail app not support by this script, such as Microsoft Outlook Mobile, Apple Mail, Google Gmail or Samsung Email.
Default value: "$($env:OneDriveCommercial)\Outlook signatures"

Mailboxes

The script only considers primary mailboxes (mailboxes added as separate
accounts), no secondary mailboxes.
This is the same way Outlook handles mailboxes from a signature
perspective.
The script is created for Exchange environments. Non-Exchange mailboxes
can not have group signatures, but common and mailbox specific
signatures.

Group membership

The script considers all groups the currently logged-on user belongs to,
as well as all groups the currently processed mailbox belongs to.
For both sets of groups, group membership is searched against the whole
Active Directory forest of the currently logged-on user as well as all
trusted domains the user can access.
The script works fine with linked mailboxes in Exchange resource forest
scenarios.
Trusted domains can be modified with the DomainsToCheckForGroups
parameter.
Group membership is achieved by querying the tokenGroups attribute,
which is not only very fast and resource saving on client and server,
but also considers sIDHistory.

Removing old signatures

The script deletes locally available signatures, if they are no longer
available centrally.
Signature created manually by the user are not deleted. The script marks
each downloaded signature with a specific HTML tag, which enables this
cleaning feature.

Error handling

Error handling is implemented rudimentarily.

Run script while Outlook is running

Outlook and the script can run simultaneously.
New and changed signatures can be used instantly in Outlook.
Changing which signature is to be used as default signature for new
mails for for replies and forwards requires restarting Outlook.

Signature file format

Only Word files with the extension .DOCX are supported as signature
template files.

Signature file naming

The script copies every signature file name as-is, with one exception:
When tags are defined in the file name, these tags are removed.
Tags must be placed before the file extension and be separated from the
base filename with a period.
Examples:

-   'Company external German.docx' -> 'Company external German.htm', no
    changes
-   'Company external German.[defaultNew].docx' -> 'Company external
    German.htm', tag(s) is/are removed
-   'Company external [English].docx' ' -> 'Company external
    [English].htm', tag(s) is/are not removed, because there is no dot
    before
-   'Company external [English].[defaultNew] [Company-AD All
    Employees].docx' ' -> 'Company external [English].htm', tag(s)
    is/are removed, because they are separated from base filename

Allowed filename tags

-   [defaultNew]
    -   Set signature as default signature for new mails
-   [defaultReplyFwd]
    -   Set signature as default signature for replies and forwarded
        mails
-   [NETBIOS-Domain Group-SamAccountName], e.g. [EXAMPLE Domain Users]
    -   Make this signature specific for an Outlook mailbox or the
        currently logged-on user being a member (direct or indirect) of
        this group
    -   Groups must be available in Active Directory. Groups like
        'Everyone' and 'Authenticated Users' only exist locally, not in
        Active Directory
-   [SMTP address], e.g. [office@example.com]
    -   Make this signature specific for the assigned mail address (all
        SMTP addresses of a mailbox are considered, not only the primary
        one)
-   [yyyyMMddHHmm-yyyyMMddHHmm], e.g. [202112150000-202112262359] for
    the 2021 Christmas season
    -   Make this signature template valid only during the specific time
        range (yyyy = year, MM = month, dd = day, HH = hour, mm =
        minute)
    -   If the script does not run after a template has expired, the
        signature is still available on the client and be used.
        Filename tags can be combined: A signature may be assigned to
        several groups, several mail addresses and several time ranges,
        be used as default signature for new e-mails and as default
        signature for replies and forwards at the same time.
        The number of possible tags is limited by Operating System file
        name and path length restrictions only. The script works with
        path names longer than the default Windows limit of 260
        characters, even when "LongPathsEnabled"
        (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation)
        is not active.

Signature application order

Signatures are applied in a specific order: Common signatures first,
group signatures second, mail address specific signatures last.
Signatures with a time range tag are only considered if the current
system time is in range of at least one of these tags.
Common signatures are signatures with either no tag or only [defaultNew]
and/or [defaultReplyFwd].
Within these groups, signatures are applied alphabetically ascending.
Every centrally stored signature is applied only once, as there is only
one signature path in Outlook, and subfolders are not allowed - so the
file names have to be unique.
The script always starts with the mailboxes in the default Outlook
profile, preferrably with the current users personal mailbox.

Variable replacement

Variables are case sensitive.
Variables are replaced everywhere in the signature files, including
links, QuickTips and alternative text of images.
With this feature, you can not only show mail addresses and telephone
numbers in the signature, but show them as links which open a new mail
message ("mailto:") or dial the number ("tel:") via a locally installed
softphone when clicked.
When using images in signatures, consider using the alternative text
feature to help visually impaired people.
Custom Active directory attributes are supported as well as custom
replacement variables, see './config/default replacement variables.txt'
for details.
Per default, './config/default replacement variables.txt' contains the
following replacement variables:

-   Currently logged-on user
    -   $CURRENTUSERGIVENNAME$: Given name
    -   $CURRENTUSERSURNAME$: Surname
    -   $CURRENTUSERDEPARTMENT$: Department
    -   $CURRENTUSERTITLE$: Title
    -   $CURRENTUSERSTREETADDRESS$: Street address
    -   $CURRENTUSERPOSTALCODE$: Postal code
    -   $CURRENTUSERLOCATION$: Location
    -   $CURRENTUSERCOUNTRY$: Country
    -   $CURRENTUSERTELEPHONE$: Telephone number
    -   $CURRENTUSERFAX$: Facsimile number
    -   $CURRENTUSERMOBILE$: Mobile phone
    -   $CURRENTUSERMAIL$: Mail address
    -   $CURRENTUSERPHOTO$: Photo from Active Directory, see Photos from
        Active Directory for details
    -   $CURRENTUSERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$: Photo from Active Directory, see
        Photos from Active Directory for details
    -   $CURRENTUSEREXTATTR1$ to $CURRENTUSEREXTATTR15$: Exchange
        Extension Attributes 1 to 15
-   Manager of currently logged-on user
    -   Same variables as logged-on user, $CURRENTUSERMANAGER[...]$
        instead of $CURRENTUSER[...]$
-   Current mailbox
    -   Same variables as logged-on user, $CURRENTMAILBOX[...]$ instead
        of $CURRENTUSER[...]$
-   Manager of current mailbox
    -   Same variables as logged-on user, $CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGER[...]$
        instead of $CURRENTMAILBOX[...]$

Photos from Active Directory

The script supports replacing images in the signature template with
photos stored in Active Directory.
As with other variables, photos can be obtained from the currently
logged-on user, it's manager, the currently processed mailbox and it's
manager.

To be able to apply Word image features such as sizing, cropping,
frames, 3D effects etc, you have to exactly follow these steps:

1.  Create a sample image file which will later be used as placeholder.
2.  Optionally: If the sample image file name contains one of the
    following variable names, the script recognizes it and you do not
    need to add the value to the alternative text of the image in step
    4:

-   $CURRENTUSERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTUSERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTUSERMANAGERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTUSERMANAGERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$

3.  Insert the image into the signature template. Make sure to use
    "Insert | Pictures | This device" (Word 2019, other versions have
    the same feature in different menus) and to select the option
    "Insert and Link" - if you forget this step, a specific Word
    property is not set and the script will not be able to replace the
    image.
4.  If you did not follow optional step 2, please add one of the
    following variable names to the alternative text of the image in
    Word (these variables are removed from the alternative text in the
    final signature):

-   $CURRENTUSERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTUSERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTUSERMANAGERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTUSERMANAGERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXPHOTODELETEEMPTY$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGERPHOTO$
-   $CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGERPHOTODELETEEMPTY$

5.  Format the image as wanted.

For the script to recognize images to replace, you need to follow at
least one of the steps 2 and 4. If you follow both, the script first
checks for step 2 first. If you provide multiple image replacement
variables, $CURRENTUSER[..]$ has the highest priority, followed by
$CURRENTUSERMANAGER[..]$, $CURRENTMAILBOX[..]$ and
$CURRENTMAILBOXMANAGER[..]$. It is recommended to use only one image
replacement variable per image.

The script will replace all images meeting the conditions described in
the steps above and replace them with Active Directory photos in the
background. This keeps Work image formatting option alive, just as if
you would use the "Change picture" function.

If there is no photo available in Active Directory, there are two
options:

-   You used the $CURRENT[...]PHOTO$ variables: The sample image used as
    placeholder is shown in the signature.
-   You used the $CURRENT[...]PHOTODELETEEMPTY$ variables: The sample
    image used as placeholder is deleted from the signature, which may
    affect the layout of the remaining signature depending on your
    formatting options.

Attention: A signature with embedded images has the expected file size
in DOCX, HTM and TXT formats, but the RTF format file will be much
bigger.
The signature template 'Test all signature replacement variables.docx'
contains several embedded images and can be used for a file comparison:

-   DOCX: 23 KB
-   HTM: 87 KB
-   RTF without workaround: 27.5 MB
-   RTF with workaround: 1.4 MB

The script uses a workaround, but the resulting RTF files are still huge
compared to other file types and especially for use in emails. If this
is a problem, please either do not use embedded images in the signature
template (including photos from Active Directory), or switch to HTML
formatted emails.

If you ran into this problem outside this script, please consider
modifying the ExportPictureWithMetafile setting as described in
https://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663.

Outlook Web

If the currently logged-on user has configured his personal mailbox in
Outlook, the default signature for new emails is configured in Outlook
Web automatically.
If the default signature for new mails matches the one used for replies
and forwarded mail, this is also set in Outlook.
If different signatures for new and reply/forward are set, only the new
signature is copied to Outlook Web.
If only a default signature for replies and forwards is set, only this
new signature is copied to Outlook Web.
If there is no default signature in Outlook, Outlook Web settings are
not changed.
All this happens with the credentials of the currently logged-on user,
without any interaction neccessary.

FAQ

Why use legacyExchangeDN to find the user behind a mailbox, and not mail or proxyAddresses?

The legacyExchangeDN attribute is used to find the user behind a
mailbox, because mail and proxyAddresses are not unique in certain
Exchange scenarios:

-   A separate Active Directory forest for users and Exchange mailboxes:
    In this case, the mail attribute is usually set in the user forest,
    although there are no mailboxes in this forest.
-   One common mail domain across multiple Exchange organizations: In
    this case, the address book is very like synchronized between Active
    Directory forests by using contacts or mail-enabled users, which
    both will have the SMTP address of the mailbox in the proxyAddresses
    attribute.
    The disadvantage of using legacyEchangeDn is that no group
    membership information can be retrieved for Exchange mailboxes
    configured as IMAP or POP accounts in Outlook. This scenario is very
    rare in Exchange/Outlook enterprise environments. These mailboxes
    can still receive common and mailbox specific signatures.

Which ports are required?

Ports 389 (LDAP) and 3268 (Global Catalog), both TCP and UDP, are
required to communicate with Active Directory domains. The client needs
the following ports to access a SMB file share on a Windows server: 137
UDP, 138 UDP, 139 TCP, 445 TCP (for details, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731402(v=ws.11).
The client needs port 443 to access a WebDAV share (a SharePoint
document library, for example).
